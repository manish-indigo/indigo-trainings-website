                    MATLAB is an abbreviation for Matrix Laboratory. MATLAB is a software package for high performance numerical computation & visualization. It provides an interactive environment with hundreds of built-in functions for technical computation graphics & animation.
                    The matrix-based MATLAB language is the worldâ€™s most natural way to express computational mathematics. MATLAB helps you take your ideas beyond the desktop. You can run your analyses on larger data sets, and scale up to clusters and
                    clouds. MATLAB is used in academic environment, research as well as in industrial applications. Typical uses of MATLAB include, Math and computation, Algorithm development, Data acquisition, Modeling, simulation, and prototyping, Data
                    analysis, exploration, and visualization, Scientific and engineering graphics, Application development, including graphical user interface building, machine learning, artificial intelligence, signal processing, image processing, optimization,
                    etc. The MATLAB language is a high-level matrix/array language with control flow statements, functions, data structures, input/output, and object-oriented programming features. It allows "programming in the small" to rapidly create
                    programs you do not intend to reuse. You can also do "programming in the large" to create complex application programs intended for reuse. MATLAB features a family of add-on application-specific solutions called toolboxes. Very important
                    to most users of MATLAB, toolboxes allow you to learn and apply specialized technology. No wonder people from Biology to Engineering to Scientists/Researchers to Economists, all use MATLAB as their preferred tool for computation, simulation
                    visualization & programming. Knowledge of MATLAB programming is a must to have a successful career. Following are the topics that will be covered in the MATLAB-Core programming course. The training will be conducted in online mode.
                    These are just the proposed topics of training. The training is customisable and contents can be changed as per the needs of the student.

                    of highly experienced professionals from industry and academia having many years of rich experience in their respective fields. There is a large gap between the technical competence of a freshly passed out graduate Engineer and the
                    technical expertise required by the industry. The industrial requirements are all together different than what is taught in the Engineering/Technology Degree/Diploma programs in various institutions. Thatâ€™s why 80% of the fresh graduates
                    that pass out do not find suitable jobs and have to depend upon the campus placements, job fairs, placement agencies, etc to get a job for themselves. Thus, there is a requirement for a specialized training which can bridge the gap,
                    so that freshly passed out Engineering graduates can become â€˜Industry Readyâ€™. Our trainings are designed to achieve this goal of making students Industry Ready. We have an extensive network of industry professionals, consultants and
                    analysts who regularly provide us with the information about the latest trends of technological innovations happening in the industry and the technical expertise required for that. According to that feedback, our course contents for
                    various trainings are updated regularly. We ensure that our students get the most advanced and latest stuff so that they become confident and can get a suitable job of their own wish. Additionally, we do help (mentor) our students
                    undergoing training in their assignments and project work. Our trainings are job-oriented & we also help our students to get jobs through our Job Placement Assistance services free of cost. We try to ensure that our trained students
                    get quality jobs which help them grow in their professional careers. All our team members are highly enthusiastic and passionate about their work and do their best to deliver high quality of trainings and services. All our students
                    get exclusive personalized attention, which help them learn the concepts at their own pace, with a solid foundation. So why wait? Have a look on our training programs & other consultancy services that we offer and choose what suits
