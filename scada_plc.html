                    PLC SCADA Automation Training Program

                <div class="fontForSubSubText">
                    PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) is considered as the work horse for modern day industry. We all know that modern industries are largely automated in nature. Behind any automation in any industrial plant we can see a PLC installation working behind
                    the scenes carrying out all the automation tasks silently day and night. PLC integrates well with SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data acquisition) Systems which are used for remote monitory and control of automatic processes. So a
                    well designed course of SCADA systems is absolutely necessary with the PLC training course. Many automatic SPM’s (Special Purpose Machines) also require HMI’s(Human Machines Interfaces) for exchange of information between humans &
                    machines, so an integrated course of HMI systems is also required. All the large motor drive systems are run by VFD’s (Variable Frequency Drives) which are indirectly controlled by PLC’s so we have included a module of training in
                    VFD’s. This training course in PLC-SCADA-HMI-VFD’s is carefully designed & developed by industrial experts having many years of experience in Industrial Automation Domain. The training program is based on Hands-On approach. Firstly
                    the candidates are given instructions and programming is taught to them on the simulation software of various PLC’s such as Siemens, Allen Bradley, Omron, Mitsubishi, Schneider etc. Students themselves program on those simulation software
                    and after that they are further trained to work on actual State-of-the-art hardware (PLC’s, SCADA, VFD) equipment. Students are trained to work on SCADA software and are taught PLC interfacing with SCADA, HMI and VFD’s. The training
                    course is divided into modules and the program is customizable according to the students needs.

                    We are a group of expert professionals and technocrats from various fields of Science & Technology who have come together on this unique platform with the aim of providing high quality Trainings & Consultancy services at affordable costs. Our team consists
                    of highly experienced professionals from industry and academia having many years of rich experience in their respective fields. There is a large gap between the technical competence of a freshly passed out graduate Engineer and the
                    technical expertise required by the industry. The industrial requirements are all together different than what is taught in the Engineering/Technology Degree/Diploma programs in various institutions. That’s why 80% of the fresh graduates
                    that pass out do not find suitable jobs and have to depend upon the campus placements, job fairs, placement agencies, etc to get a job for themselves. Thus, there is a requirement for a specialized training which can bridge the gap,
                    so that freshly passed out Engineering graduates can become ‘Industry Ready’. Our trainings are designed to achieve this goal of making students Industry Ready. We have an extensive network of industry professionals, consultants and
                    analysts who regularly provide us with the information about the latest trends of technological innovations happening in the industry and the technical expertise required for that. According to that feedback, our course contents for
                    various trainings are updated regularly. We ensure that our students get the most advanced and latest stuff so that they become confident and can get a suitable job of their own wish. Additionally, we do help (mentor) our students
                    undergoing training in their assignments and project work. Our trainings are job-oriented & we also help our students to get jobs through our Job Placement Assistance services free of cost. We try to ensure that our trained students
                    get quality jobs which help them grow in their professional careers. All our team members are highly enthusiastic and passionate about their work and do their best to deliver high quality of trainings and services. All our students
                    get exclusive personalized attention, which help them learn the concepts at their own pace, with a solid foundation. So why wait? Have a look on our training programs & other consultancy services that we offer and choose what suits
                    you the best! Don’t forget to book a free Demonstration session with our training expert before joining the training of your choice. We also undertake on-site training programs for academia as well as corporate environments. We also
                    provide consultancy services in the field of IT and automation. We help our clients in product development, prototyping, automation, experimental setups for measurement of physical quantities, testing machines and special purpose machines.
